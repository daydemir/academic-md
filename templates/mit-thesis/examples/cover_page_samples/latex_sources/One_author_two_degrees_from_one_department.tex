% option [twoside]		gives facing-page behavior for printing; omitting it will eliminate even-numbered blank pages.
% option [lineno]	 	provides line numbers, as for editing
% option [mydesign] 	loads titlesec, enumitem, caption, subcaption - you may edit the mydesign.tex file as you like it.
% option [fontset] is a keyvalue which can be:
%					 	pdftex or unicode engines:  defaultfonts, libertine, lucida
%					 	pdftex only: 				fira-newtxsf, newtx, newtx-sans-text
%						unicode engines (luatex):	heros-stix2, stix2, termes, termes-stix2
%					 	if no key value is given, fonts default to CMR (pdftex) or LMR (unicode), i.e., "the latex font".
%					 	You can edit the fontset files or you can write your own, myfonts.tex, and do [fontset=myfonts].
%						If you are using multiple languages, load the babel package in your fontset file, before the fonts.

% Most of the document metadata is created automatically. 
% The following items should be adjusted to match your work. <================= !!!!!!!!!!

\hypersetup{%
	pdfsubject={Template for writing MIT theses with the mitthesis class},
	% Change this to briefly state topic of your thesis 
% 
	pdfkeywords={Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT},
	% Add keywords that will help search engines and libraries to find your work.
	% Includes the name[s] of the author[s] 
	% (If you have used \DocumentMetadata, at line 15, you can just put "\CopyrightAuthor," for the names.)
%
	pdfurl={},
	% If you have a url for the thesis, put it here. Otherwise delete this.
	% (MIT Libraries will put your thesis in DSPACE with a persistent url after you submit it.)

	pdfcontactemail={},
	% You can put a [permanent] email address into the metadata, if you like.
